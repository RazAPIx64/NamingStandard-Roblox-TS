# Unified Naming Convention written in Roblox-TS

This project is supposed to help me learn Roblox-TS along the way, so i've created Roblox-TS types for UNC functions which is supposed to
help me in the near future, Including the UNC Test rewritten in Roblox-TS.

All credits to the original developers of the Unified Naming Convention

Project was already written locally instead of being on Github, so i'll pretty much have to come back and add a bundler for it
